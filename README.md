# Data Visualization

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that provide an introduction to data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries. The first notebook introduces basic plotting techniques with Matplotlib and Seaborn, while the second notebook performs an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset.

## Notebooks

### 1. Introduction to Data Visualization

This notebook covers various plots and charts using Matplotlib and Seaborn. The focus is on understanding the basics of data visualization, including:

- **Line Plots**: Visualizing time series data.
- **Pie Charts**: Distribution of different categories.
- **Scatter Plots**: Relationship between two variables.
- **Bar Charts**: Better alternative to pie charts for small differences.
- **Box and Whisker Plots**: Visualizing distributions and outliers.
- **Histograms**: Understanding the frequency distribution of data.

#### Contents:
- **Matplotlib**
  - Line plot
  - Pie chart
  - Scatter plot
  - Bar chart
  - Box and whisker plot

### 2. Titanic Dataset EDA

This notebook uses the Titanic dataset from the Seaborn library to perform a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). It includes univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis to uncover insights about the dataset.

#### Contents:
- **Data Cleaning**
  - Handling missing values
- **Univariate Analysis**
  - Countplots
